On April 22, 2022 732 days ago, we began this journey of love, a journey filled with beauty even though we have never met in person. Our relationship is proof that love knows no bounds, not hindered by distance or time. Our love story is not just about the moments we've shared, but about the promise of what lies ahead. It's about the commitment we've made to each other, to grow together, to support each other through life's ups and downs. It's about the unwavering belief in our love, a belief that is as strong as the foundation of a mountain, as enduring as the sea. Over these past two years, we have gone through a lot together. Although there are occasional small arguments, we always find a way to resolve them and come back stronger. This shows how deep our understanding and love for each other are. Every day, our love deepens, strengthening the bond we have built with patience and dedication. I can't wait for May 13, 2024, counting from today, in 21 days when we will meet for the first time. I am sure it will be one of the most beautiful days of my lives and i hope you will feel like that too my angell. As we navigate the uncharted waters of our future together, let's hold onto the promise of our love. A promise that is as vast as the ocean, as boundless as the sky, and as enduring as the mountains. A promise that is ours, a promise that is ours to keep, and a promise that is ours to cherish. Let's continue to keep this love with all tenderness and warmth my only future wife.";

    var pesan2 = "Baharın müjdecisi nergisler açarken, Seninle başladığımız bu yolculukta, Her bir yaprak gibi katman katman açıldı kalbim. Gözlerinin derinliğinde kaybolduğum, Ve sesinin melodisinde huzur bulduğum, Seninle her bahar daha anlamlı, her gün daha değerli. Nergisler gibi, uzun kışın ardından, Yeniden doğuyoruz her gün birlikte, Ve her anı sımsıkı sarılıp, değerini biliyoruz. Seninle geçen her gün, bir ömre bedel, Ve bil ki, her daim yanındayım, Gönülden gönüle bir köprü kurarak."
